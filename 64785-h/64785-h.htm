<p class='c005'>most of whom sacrificed much time, many of whom sacrificed their health,
and several gave their lives, in the care, nursing and relief of the stricken
people of Luzerne County during the world epidemic, and whose measures
of relief were gratefully received by our people, many of whom were
aliens and strangers, who, understanding little of our language, nevertheless
understood the care and love bestowed upon them at the time of their
great affliction.</p>
<p class='c006'>History records many instances of epidemics, famines and wars,
where measures of relief were taken for those who were most sorely
afflicted, and the battlefields of our recent war scintillate with heroism.
Individuals, platoons, whole companies and regiments offered themselves
for their fellow men, and future historians will vie with one another in
their endeavor to have live the thousands of heroic incidents in the great
World War, to the end that they may serve as lamps for the feet of coming
generations of freemen.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nevertheless, civic life—those back home, those who were not inspired
in the presence of the glare and pageantry of military life, those
whose call to duty was heard and as readily performed in no less a measure
of satisfaction—were willing and anxious to take part in the work
demanded of humanity, and were ready to give their all, if need be,
for those who so sorely needed succor.</p>

<p class='c006'>We are proud of the citizens of Luzerne County—we are proud of
the men and women who live on the fair hills and in the valleys of this
County—and as a people we are most grateful for the services so willingly
offered, the sacrifices so commonly made, and the heroic work so opportunely
accomplished.</p>

<p class='c006'>This devotion given and shown to their fellow men, to women and to
helpless children, testifies splendidly to a love of country and of fellow
men, as well as to that love of humanity taught by the lowly and great
Nazarene.</p>

<p class='c006'>This expression, so briefly recorded here, is intended as a testimonial
of, and appreciation for, each individual identified with the care and
relief of the stricken people of Luzerne County. A record is herewith
preserved of the names, so far as known, of those who are thus entitled
to receive the same.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Committee in whose hands the organization and distribution of
relief was placed, testifies in this brief way to the splendid work accomplished,
and the highly successful co-operative movement of the State,
County, Cities and Towns, and does so, with the thought that their fellow
citizens, when they shall have read of the epidemic as here set forth, will
feel that they are duly bound to express personally, and publicly, whenever
occasion offers, something of their willingness to give a full measure
of approval to those who made sacrifices in the work so nobly done.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_675 c013'>EARLY in September, 1918, the United States was invaded
by a scourge of highly infectious and fatal disease, which
spread with rapidity throughout the country. It was
pandemic in its nature, and partook of many of the characteristics
of influenza, grip and pneumonia. No one seemed to know
much about the disease or its treatment, and medical science and
public health agencies were alike unprepared to cope with it.</p>

<p class='c006'>About all that could be done at the start was to adopt and
attempt to enforce drastic regulations to minimize contagion; but
even in view of these regulations, and when the plague had burst
forth in all its widespread malignity, the country at large seemed
slow to awaken to the enormity of the peril which it faced.</p>

<p class='c006'>It certainly was a disconcerting fact that, at the very time when
vast numbers of the people in widely-distributed localities had
organized themselves, through the Red Cross and other well-known
and efficient mediums, to fight disease and prevent suffering
and death, we should be smitten with a visitation which caused
more casualties and deaths among the peaceful citizens in the
homeland than the deadly missiles and poisonous gases of the
enemy effected among the American Expeditionary Forces overseas
in the great World War.</p>

<p class='c006'>From September  9 to November  9, according to reports received
by the Federal Census Bureau from forty-six large cities
in the United States having a combined population of  23,000,000
souls, there was a total of  82,306 deaths attributed to the scourge.
In a similar period of time, in the same communities, the normal
number of deaths dues to influenza and pneumonia would have
been about  4,000.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the latter part of September  85,000 cases in Massachusetts
alone were reported; and by the first week in October the disease
was prevalent in nearly all sections of the United States—twenty-three
States, from Massachusetts in the East to California
in the West, and from Florida in the South-east to Washington
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>in the North-west, were experiencing the mysterious malady.
More than  14,000 cases in the military camps of the country were
reported to the office of the Surgeon General of the Army within
one period of twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class='c006'>Up to January  4,  1919, according to the Census Bureau, the
mortality due to the fatal disease was  115,258 in forty-six cities
of the United States containing one-fifth of the population of the
country; while, according to statistics submitted to the Actuarial
Society of America in July,  1919,  450,000 deaths occurred in the
United States in the Autumn and early Winter of  1918 due to
this pandemic disease—which wrought its greatest havoc among
infants and persons in adult working life. The mortality of
males was greater than that of females, while the highest mortality
caused by the disease affected persons of the wage-earning
class—especially those situated in the lowest economic range.</p>

<p class='c006'>The origin or source of the disease was unknown. Some
experts looked upon it as simply a variety of a well-known disease
prevalent, with occasional outbreaks of violence, for hundreds
of years. Others attempted to identify it with a form of pneumonic
plague that has raged in parts of China for a number of
years past—China and its neighboring lands in Asia forming a
vast storehouse of infection from which great epidemics have
swept in waves across and around the globe.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is an historic fact that, in the early part of  1917 about  200,000
coolies, collected from the northern part of China (where the
pneumonic plague had raged for six or seven years), were sent to
France as laborers, and with them went the germs of the pneumonic
plague. Many of these coolies were captured by the Germans
in the Spring of  1918—hence the outbreak of the plague,
at that time, in the German army, where it is said to have been
very serious in its deadly character.</p>

<p class='c006'>There were some writers of the press who declared that the
disease had been brought into this country in German submarine
boats; but when it was realized that, like a scourge of the Middle
Ages, it was sweeping through Europe—no part of which, civilized
or barbarian, was exempt—it was called by many experts a
by-product of the World War.</p>

<p class='c006'>The manner of the pandemic’s appearance in different countries
indicated that the germs of the disease had been conveyed thither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>by the currents of the air. Therefore the theory was broached,
that the poison gases, with which many sectors of the fighting
area in Europe and Asia were drenched, were carried by the
winds in every direction, causing the outbreak of the pandemic in
England, Germany, France, Spain, Australia, Africa and Asia,
as well as in North America and some of the South American
countries.</p>

<p class='c006'>The disease took its deadly toll even in lonely Labrador, in the
“silent North” of the Western Hemisphere, where ice-floes from
farther north fill every harbor of the rock-bound coast; where
giant icebergs, miles in length, mountains in height and acres in
extent bar the paths of ships and steamers. “A land where railroads
are unknown, where streets are never laid nor roads built
to connect one settlement with another; a country where horses
and cows are less known than are the rhinoceros and zebra to the
inhabitants of the United States; a region where even canned
milk is a luxury and candy is seldom seen.”</p>

<p class='c006'>On all the desolate coast of Labrador, extending over eight
degrees of latitude, not a doctor nor a trained nurse, not a hospital
nor a dispensary, not even a health officer, was to be found.
Eskimo and Indian, German and Briton, halfbreed and white,
hunter and fisherman, fell victims to the dreaded scourge, which
traveled with rapidity. Whole settlements were left without a
single survivor—the unburied corpses being devoured by half-starved
dogs. This is the story that came out of the “silent
North”—the most gruesome, most awful, tale of disease and death
that the world has heard in many a day!</p>

<p class='c006'>Following the outbreak of the scourge in Germany it was next
heard of in Spain, where it received the name “Spanish influenza”.
This is really a misnomer, but it has stuck, probably
because the disease to which it was applied was the first epidemic
of influenza Spain had ever experienced. This name accompanied
the disease to the United States, where, by some slangologists, it
was early transmogrified into “flu”—by which appellation it has
been pretty commonly designated.</p>

<p class='c006'>The scourge invaded Pennsylvania about the middle of September,  1918, simultaneously attacking widely-separated communities.
On October  1 the Department of Health of the Commonwealth
issued orders directing the closing of all moving-picture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>houses, theaters and places of amusement in general;
that public assemblages be discontinued; that funerals be privately
conducted; that all bar-rooms and wholesale liquor establishments
be closed. The matter of closing schools, churches and Sunday schools
was left to the discretion of local authorities. In addition,
the Department issued proclamations and appeals for hearty
coöperation on the part of the general public in checking the
ravages of the scourge.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Wilkes-Barré on October 3, 4 and 5 the directions and
appeals of the State Department of Health were promptly and
cheerfully complied with (even clubs and the various fraternal
orders and societies observing the mandates, while the sessions of
the Courts of Luzerne County for the week beginning October  7
were continued and postponed), although on the first day of the
appearance of the disease here only twenty cases were officially
reported.</p>

<p class='c006'>Owing to the absence of many local physicians and trained
nurses in the military and naval services of the United States,
Wyoming Valley Chapter of the Red Cross issued an appeal on
October 3 for trained nurses and for women with some nursing
experience to register with the Chapter for service in combating
the disease here.</p>

<p class='c006'>Under the date of October 8 the Commissioner of Health of
Pennsylvania issued a circular letter to Department of Health
and other physicians “engaged in the State-wide organization
against the Influenza Epidemic,” in which, among other things,
the following information and instructions were set forth:</p>

<p class='c014'>“From close observation of the progress of the pandemic of influenza
which is now sweeping upon us from the Atlantic seaboard, it has been
decided by the Governor of this Commonwealth, the Commissioner of
Health and the Advisory Board of the Pennsylvania Department of Health
to use the organization at hand, and all available organizations that will
co-operate to the utmost, in an effort to save the lives of our people.
Accordingly, after careful thought, the following [among other] plans
have been adopted:</p>

<p class='c015'>“The State Department of Health to be in absolute control and take
full responsibility.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The formation of nineteen Epidemic Emergency Districts, with a representative
of the Department in full charge of each district, taking his
orders directly from the Commissioner of Health and transmitting them
to those who answer the call.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>“Appeals to all Health, Patriotic, Civic, Religious, Business and Social
organizations, such as the Red Cross (graduates in elementary hygiene
and home care of the sick, or first aid), Associated Charities, Boards of
Health, Mayors, Councils, County Commissioners, Directors of the Poor,
Boards of Trade, Church Societies, Fraternal Orders, Women’s Clubs,
Boy Scouts, Motor Messenger Corps, trained nurses, practical attendants,
lay workers and volunteer automobilists, to lend all possible assistance
under the direction of the Department.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The Adjutant General has placed the entire State Guard, and all the
equipment of his department, at our disposal for the erection of emergency
hospitals, furnishing of supplies, safe-guarding of property and the maintenance
of discipline.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Requests for aid from stricken communities should be made to the
nearest representative of the Department, who will refer them to the
physician in charge of the Epidemic Emergency District. This includes
calls for doctors, nurses, aids, materials and any other form of relief. The
Department will make a supreme effort to satisfy all such needs as rapidly
as possible. However, where these are at hand, they should be obtained
locally. * * *</p>

<p class='c015'>“All attendants should wear masks. * * *</p>

<p class='c015'>“Treatment of Influenza and Pneumonia. * * *”</p>

<p class='c016'>In furthering the foregoing plans and regulations Dr. Charles
H. Miner of Wilkes-Barré, who was at that time, and had been
for ten years, County Medical Inspector of the State Department
of Health for Luzerne County, was appointed on October  8, by the
Acting Commissioner of Health (Dr. B. Franklin Royer), “to
take full charge of the organization and co-ordination of all
work in District No.  5,” composed of Luzerne and Columbia
Counties, with headquarters at Wilkes-Barré.</p>

<p class='c006'>The same day the Acting Commissioner telephoned from Harrisburg
to the County Medical Inspector at Wilkes-Barré, informing
the latter of his appointment as aforementioned, and asking
him to request Maj. Gen. C. B. Dougherty of Wilkes-Barré to
aid him in arranging and setting forward plans for the proper
handling of the situation in the  5th District.</p>

<p class='c006'>General Dougherty responded promptly to the call for his services,
and he and the County Medical Inspector soon concluded,
in view of the fact that the regular and permanent hospitals
located in the  5th District were just about “crowded to their
limits” with influenza and pneumonic patients, and that the new
cases reported each day in the various communities were becoming
more numerous, that it would be necessary to establish and
equip several emergency hospitals.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>It was decided to establish an Emergency Hospital in Wilkes-Barré
(where, on October  8, sixty new cases of influenza had
been reported to the County Medical Inspector), and the armory
of the  9th Regiment, National Guard of Pennsylvania, located on
South Main Street, was selected for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>For some time then the 2d Infantry, Pennsylvania Reserve
Militia (Col. S. E. W. Eyer commanding), had occupied the
armory as its headquarters. On October  8 Colonel Eyer turned
over the armory to the representatives of the Department of
Health, and immediately, under the direction and supervision of
General Dougherty, the work of thoroughly scrubbing and cleaning
the building from top to bottom was begun and was rapidly
completed. Then the Shepherd Construction Company of Wilkes-Barré
began the erection of four wards on the drill floor of the
armory.</p>

<p class='c006'>Each of these wards was  21×27 feet in area by  10 feet in height,
the walls, or partitions, being constructed of hemlock studding
covered with beaver board. Each ward had a capacity of fifteen
cots,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c017'><sup>[1]</sup></a> whereby ample air space was allowed for each patient.
Considerable plumbing work had to be installed in order to facilitate
the efforts of nurses and attendants in giving proper care and
attention to the hospital patients. This plumbing work, when
completed, represented an outlay of $605.49. Also, the lighting
facilities of the armory not being sufficient, it was necessary to
install additional wiring and lights throughout the entire building,
which was done at an expense of $190.</p>

<div class='footnote c018' id='f1'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This arrangement provided accommodations for sixty patients, which, later on,
were found to be insufficient to meet the demands for admission to the hospital;
whereupon four more wards of the same dimensions and materials were erected.
These wards, when completed, gave the hospital eight wards with a total capacity of  120 beds. Of these eight wards six were used for patients in general as admitted, one
was used as an isolation ward (where patients in the last stage of pneumonia were
placed), and one was used as a ward for convalescents.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The basement of the armory was transformed into a commodious
and comfortable dining-room; the kitchen was painted
white, made sanitary in every respect, and its floor was covered
with oil-cloth, while gas ranges were connected and refrigerators
were installed. A diet kitchen (separate from the main kitchen)
was established convenient to the main floor of the armory.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the evening of October  9, upon invitation of the County
Medical Inspector, the following-named ladies and gentlemen
assembled in the auditorium of the Wilkes-Barré Chamber
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>of Commerce, “for the purpose of taking steps for combating
influenza”: Dr. Charles H. Miner, Dr. S. P. Mengel,
Dr. G. A. Clark, Dr. E. L. Meyers, Dr. Charles Long,
Gen. C. B. Dougherty, Col. S. E. W. Eyer, Lewis P.
Kniffen, E. E. Matthews, Anthony C. Campbell, M. J. McLaughlin,
John D. Farnham, M. H. Sigafoos, Maj. E. N.
Carpenter, William H. Conyngham, Frederick E. Zerbey, George
J. Hartman, Hayden Williams, Mrs. C. H. Miner, Mrs. E. Birney
Carr and Miss Josephine Tracy of Wilkes-Barré; Dr. W. B.
Stricker, Dr. J. Hughes, Michael Douk, T. A. Butkiewicz, C. J.
Donahey, John Badman and F. H. Kohlbraker of Nanticoke;
R. Alvan Beisel of Hazleton; Mrs. W. A. Lathrop of Dorranceton;
Dr. J. A. Hilbert, Miss Esther J. Tinsley, Dr. S. L. Underwood
and William J. Peck of Pittston; R. A. Mulhall of West
Pittston; Dr. S. B. Arment of Bloomsburg; Dr. D. H. Lake, S. H.
Hicks and W. B. Crane of Kingston.</p>

<p class='c006'>General Dougherty was called upon to preside, and Hayden
Williams, Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce, acted as Secretary
of the meeting.</p>

<p class='c006'>The County Medical Inspector spoke at great length with respect
to the work already done in the 5th District to combat the
pandemic—referring particularly to the emergency hospital which
had been established at Wanamie, in Newport Township, Luzerne
County, and to the preparations being made for the opening of the
Armory Emergency Hospital in Wilkes-Barré. He stated that he
had divided the 5th District into five sub-districts, with Dr. S. B.
Arment in charge of the work in Columbia County, Dr. J. W.
Leckie in charge of the Hazleton sub-district, Dr. W. B. Stricker
in charge of a district extending from Nanticoke south to the
Columbia County line, Dr. S. L. Underwood in charge of a district
extending from the borough of Wyoming to the Lackawanna
County line, while he, himself, in addition to a general supervision
of affairs in the 5th District, had assumed charge of the work in
the territory extending from Wyoming to Nanticoke. He suggested
that committees on automobiles, food, drugs and general
hospital supplies should be appointed.</p>

<p class='c006'>General Dougherty gave an account of the serious conditions
existing at Minersville and Shamokin in the 3d District, adjoining
the 5th District. Dr. Underwood and Miss Tinsley spoke of conditions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>in Exeter, Luzerne County, where nearly  300 cases then
existed. They reported that there were  182 cases in  62 homes;
that  98 patients were convalescing; that  10 families were in dire
need of help, and that there was a special urgency for women to
help in the house-work of afflicted families.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Hughes said that there were  400 cases at Glen Lyon and
Wanamie in Newport Township; that sanitary conditions were
bad; that there was a lack of nurses, and that the High School
building at Wanamie had just been converted into an emergency
hospital.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. G. A. Clark, head of the Wilkes-Barré City Health Department,
stated that about  200 cases had been reported in the city,
and that the municipality would bear its proper share of the
expense incurred in efforts to check the disease.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Lake stated that there were  36 cases in Kingston and  40 in
Edwardsville, and that there had been two or three deaths from
the disease. In one home in Edwardsville there were seven cases.
He declared that the closing of the schools had helped somewhat
in checking the spread of the disease, and that considerable good
could be accomplished if Toby’s Creek, which had never been
cleaned, were placed in a sanitary condition.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Arment stated that conditions in Catawissa, Columbia
County, were bad; that a hospital was needed there, but it was
impossible to procure nurses. Six deaths had occurred thus far
in that locality, and the disease seemed to be spreading. He suggested
that the school-houses in Bloomsburg be converted into
emergency hospitals, and reported that the saloons in Centralia
were wide open and doing business as usual.</p>

<p class='c006'>W. H. Conyngham, representing Wyoming Valley Chapter of
the American Red Cross, stated that his organization had no
funds with which to pay nurses, but that the members of the
Chapter stood ready to do anything in their power to combat the
disease.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Mengel, Chief Surgeon of The Lehigh Valley Coal Company,
placed the nurses of that organization at the disposal of
the community, and suggested that school teachers should be
employed to help in the work of caring for the sick.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. E. Birney Carr reported that the Canteen Service of the
Wyoming Valley Chapter of the Red Cross would render all the
assistance possible, while Mr. McLaughlin, one of the Commissioners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>of Luzerne County, gave assurance that the County would
render any assistance possible to help stamp out the disease.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Secretary of the Wilkes-Barré Chamber of Commerce
volunteered the assistance of the Chamber’s staff in handling all
details of the work connected with the campaign. Dr. Charles
Long suggested that an effort be made to secure financial and
other assistance from the Board of Directors of the Central Poor
District of Luzerne County.</p>

<p class='c006'>Anthony C. Campbell, Esq., County Fuel Administrator, told
of the serious conditions with respect to the mining industry in
the 5th District, and declared that the output of anthracite coal
was being seriously affected by the pandemic. On motion of Mr.
Campbell it was then unanimously voted: That such emergency
hospitals as the County Medical Inspector deemed necessary be
established, that those in charge of the work incident to combating
the influenza-pneumonia scourge should call upon the Board of
Directors of the Central Poor District, County officials and the
various municipal officers in the 5th District for financial assistance
in defraying such expenses as may be necessarily incurred in
carrying on their work, and that the County Medical Inspector be
given any and all assistance required.</p>

<p class='c006'>The meeting then adjourned, and within a day or two thereafter
the County Medical Inspector announced the appointment
of various committees “to coöperate with the State Department
of Health in the 5th District with respect to the influenza
epidemic,” as follows:</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>General Committee.</span>—To have general supervision over the

<p class='c014'>“Impress every member of the community organization with the seriousness
of the situation, and make each one responsible toward having people
obey all instructions.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Remember that it is easier to prevent an epidemic than to stop one
when conditions become dangerous.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t frighten people about the situation, but constantly prevail upon
them to be careful in not exposing themselves to disease or spreading it.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Permit no public gatherings or large groups on street corners, in

<p class='c015'>“Permit no public funerals, and have a police or health officer attend all

<p class='c015'>“Let ‘Safety First’ be the motto of all people.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It is especially requested that all schools and churches be closed.”</p>

<p class='c016'>In pursuance of the resolution adopted at the meeting held in
the Chamber of Commerce on October  9, as aforementioned, Dr.
Miner gave directions for the establishing of emergency hospitals
at the following-named places—in addition to those already arranged
for at Wanamie and in the Armory at Wilkes-Barré:
Catawissa, Exeter, Hazleton, Dupont, Nanticoke and Plains.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c017'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c018' id='f2'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At this time the regular, or permanently established, hospitals located in the 5th District were as follows: Wilkes-Barré City, Mercy, Wyoming Valley Homœopathic
and Riverside Hospitals in Wilkes-Barré; Nesbitt West Side Hospital, Dorranceton;
Pittston Hospital, Pittston; Berwick Hospital, Berwick, Columbia County;
State Hospital of the Middle Coal Field of Pennsylvania, Hazleton; State Hospital,
Nanticoke; Bloomsburg Hospital, Bloomsburg, Columbia County.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>On October  10 the first emergency hospital was opened, in the
Central High School building at Wanamie, with Dr. William H.
Corrigan physician in charge and Miss Emily G. Jones, Graduate
Nurse, as chief nurse. The same day the emergency hospital at
Catawissa was opened, with Dr. S. B. Arment physician in charge
and Miss Hannah C. Breisch, Graduate Nurse, as chief nurse.
On October  11 the third emergency hospital was opened, in the
High School building at Exeter, with Dr. James Dixon physician
in charge and Miss Jessie Cunningham and Mrs. Ernest W.
Hogg, Graduate Nurses, as chief nurses.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Elmer L. Hinman, having been sent to Wilkes-Barré by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Dr. Royal S. Copeland, Commissioner of the Health Department
of the city of New York, reported to the County Medical Inspector
for duty on October  12, and was assigned to the Wanamie
Emergency Hospital to assist Dr. Corrigan.</p>

<p class='c006'>At this time it was estimated that there were at least 1,000
influenza and pneumonia cases, reported and unreported, in
Wilkes-Barré—new cases appearing at the rate of nearly 100 per
day. The Wilkes-Barré City Hospital refused, because of lack
of room and nurses, to receive any more cases. Nurses and
doctors everywhere were overworked, and the situation at Glen
Lyon (in Newport Township) and in Hazleton and its vicinity
was appalling.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the afternoon of October 12 a meeting of Chairmen of
committees and Division Chairman was held with the County
Medical Inspector at the rooms of the Chamber of Commerce,
when it was decided that trucks should be secured for the purpose
of delivering food daily to the homes of the sick, where such service
was needed. Whereupon Percy A. Brown and Frank F.
Matheson each offered trucks for this purpose. It was suggested
that Mrs. P. J. Higgins of Wilkes-Barré should be placed in
charge of the cooking at the Armory canteen—the necessary
arrangements for this service, however, to be left in the hands of
the Canteen Committee.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Mengel suggested that a telegram be sent to the proper
authorities at Washington, urging them to leave here, during the
progress of the epidemic, all Red Cross nurses now in this
vicinity. General Dougherty reported that he had communicated
with the Hon. A. Mitchell Palmer and other Government officials
at Washington relative to having army surgeons sent here from
Camp Crane, Allentown, Pennsylvania, and he had been assured
that ten officers of the Medical Department would be sent.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. S. M. Wolfe of Wilkes-Barré, who had recently returned
from Massachusetts, where he had assisted in combating the
epidemic, told of the various organized methods and plans pursued
in dealing with the disease in that State.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. William J. Ruff, Cashier of the Luzerne County National
Bank, Wilkes-Barré, was then elected Treasurer of the General
Committee.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the close of this meeting General Dougherty telegraphed to
Maj. Gen. Rupert Blue, Surgeon General, U.S.A., Dr. H. A.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Garfield, U. S. Fuel Administrator, and Miss Carrie Noyes,
Director of Field Nursing, American Red Cross, at Washington,
D. C., as follows:</p>

<p class='c014'>“The following Red Cross nurses have been called to leave for service
on Tuesday, October 15: Miss Edith Evans, Miss Elsie Banker and Mrs.
Lena Krum of Wilkes-Barré; Miss Hazel Smith of Tunkhannock, Pa.,
and Miss Bessie Evans of Kingston, Pa. The influenza situation in
Wyoming Valley is of such a serious nature, and there is such a dearth of
nurses, that, as Chairman of the General Committee of Wyoming Valley
(whose efforts are being directed toward the stamping out of this pestilence,
in order to conserve the lives of our citizens and thus maintain the
production of anthracite coal, which is now seriously affected by the prevailing
sickness), I appeal to you to direct these nurses to remain here to
take up their duties in emergency hospitals now being established. I trust
that this appeal will be fully appreciated by you. We are fearfully short
of nurses as well as doctors. We can use a great many physicians and
nurses.”</p>

<p class='c016'>On October 13 the following-named medical officers from
Camp Crane arrived at Wilkes-Barré, and were assigned to duty
by Dr. Miner, as noted: Capt. E. L. Hendricks, U. S. Marine
Corps, and Lieut. C. F. Bahler, to Glen Lyon; Lieut. Joseph Goldstone,
U. S. Marine Corps, to Bloomsburg; Lieut. G. T. Meek to
Exeter, and Lieut. J. a.m. Aspy to Hazleton.</p>

<p class='c006'>At a meeting of the General Committee held in the auditorium
of the Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday, October 15, General
Dougherty presented a report relative to conditions at Shamokin
and Minersville (in the 3d District), where there were  4,000 cases
of the “flu”. Col. Eyer reported on the work being done at the
Armory to fit it for hospital purposes, and Dr. Miner stated that
the Armory Emergency Hospital would be ready for the reception
of patients at noon on the following day.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Rev. John J. McCabe, of St. Joseph’s R. C. Church,
Georgetown, told of conditions in Wilkes-Barré Township, where,
he said, there were 80 cases of the disease. Dr. Hughes stated
that there were about 585 cases in Newport Township and
vicinity, and Richard Sheridan reported that there were possibly
over 200 cases in Nanticoke.</p>

<p class='c006'>On motion of the Rev. Mr. McCabe the Chairman named Dr.
C. H. Miner, the Rev. J. F. Jedlicka and Dr. E. L. Meyers as a
committee to confer with the Controller and Commissioners of
Luzerne County, and the Directors of the Central Poor District,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>for the purpose of securing financial aid in fighting the epidemic.
Controller Hendershot, who was present, stated that he would do
everything in his power to co-operate with the General Committee
in its work. James L. Reilly, Secretary of the Central District
Poor Board, who was present, stated that he felt sure the Poor
Board would co-operate with the Committee.</p>

<p class='c006'>Frederick E. Zerbey, Superintendent of the Kingston Coal
Company, offered the use of the ambulances of that company to
convey patients from the west side of the river.</p>

<p class='c006'>General Dougherty stated that the State would pay for doctors,
nurses, tents, cots, blankets, sheets, etc., employed and used in
combating the epidemic, but that all other service would have to
be paid for with funds derived from other sources.</p>

<p class='c006'>On October 16 the Hazleton Emergency Hospital was opened
in the building of St. Gabriel’s High School, Hazleton, with Lieut.
J. a.m. Aspy physician in charge and Miss Ruth B. Rae, Graduate
Nurse, from the Department of Health, as chief nurse.
(Later, Miss Rae was stricken with the “flu” and was succeeded
as chief nurse by the Mother Superior of St. Gabriel’s, who was
a professional nurse. On October 25 Lieutenant Aspy returned
to Camp Crane, and was succeeded by Dr. J. W. Leckie as physician
in charge at Hazleton.)</p>

<p class='c006'>On October 12 the Armory Emergency Hospital at Wilkes-Barré
was ready with four wards for the reception of patients.
Lack of nurses, however, delayed the opening of the hospital
until Wednesday, October 16, when, with Capt. E. L. Hendricks,
U.S.M.C., as physician in charge, and Mrs. J. Pryor Williamson
of Wilkes-Barré, Graduate Nurse, as chief nurse, the doors
were opened at one o’clock p.m. for the reception of patients.
During the afternoon six female and five male patients from
Wilkes-Barré, Nanticoke, Parsons and Miner’s Mills were received,
and on the following day eleven males and seven females
were received from Wilkes-Barré, Edwardsville, Plymouth,
Miner’s Mills, Maltby, Nanticoke and Forty Fort.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sixth Emergency Hospital in the 5th District was opened
on October 17 in the Pulaski School building at Dupont, Luzerne
County, with Dr. W. S. Helman of Avoca as visiting physician
and Miss Herman, Graduate Nurse, as chief nurse. (Dr. Helman
was succeeded on November  9 by Dr. James S. Dixon, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Miss Herman was succeeded on November 19 by Miss Bessie
Fadden.)</p>

<p class='c006'>The seventh Emergency Hospital was opened on October 17 in
the Washington School building at Nanticoke, Luzerne County,
with Dr. Elmer L. Hinman in charge and Miss Olwen Williams,
Graduate Nurse, as chief nurse. (Dr. Hinman returned to New
York City on October 26, and was succeeded by Lieut. C. E.
Yates.)</p>

<p class='c006'>On October 17 two medical students, Messrs. J. A. Post and
W. R. Stewart, of the University of Buffalo, reported to the
County Medical Inspector at Wilkes-Barré to help out with the
work of the 5th District. Mr. Stewart was assigned to assist Dr.
Corrigan at the Wanamie Hospital, and Mr. Post was assigned to
the Exeter, and subsequently to the Plains, Emergency Hospital.</p>

<p class='c006'>The same day the following-named Army Surgeons arrived at
Wilkes-Barré and were assigned to the Hazleton District: Captains
Davenport and Danfort to work at Jeddo; Captain Brown
at Cranberry; Captain Wroth at Lattimer and Major Wyer in
Hazleton. On October 19, however, all these Surgeons were
ordered to return to Camp Crane, Allentown.</p>

<p class='c006'>On October 18 a largely-attended meeting of the General Committee
was held, with General Dougherty, Chairman, presiding.
The latter outlined the objects and purposes in view with respect
to the emergency hospitals which had been established, stating
that only patients who could not receive proper attention at their
homes should be sent to the hospitals. He also set forth the fact
that there was a very great shortage of doctors and nurses in this
District, and called upon Miss Nellie G. Loftus, the State nurse
in charge of the nurses in this section, to make a statement as to
conditions here. This she did, setting forth that there were thirty
graduate nurses in the 5th District, five or six of whom were not
in active service on account of illness. There were also eleven
practical nurses in the District, but at least fifty more graduate
nurses could, and should, be placed in service immediately.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. W. C. Shepherd then made the following motion, which
was adopted:</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is the sense of this meeting that all patriotic citizens will, in every
case where possible so to do, release nurses from their private employ for
the general good of the community. It is their patriotic duty to do this
during the present grave emergency.”</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Mr. Percy A. Brown, Chairman of the Coöperation Committee,
stated that the territory in Luzerne County had been divided
into forty sub-districts, and that he had arranged to have an
organization in each sub-district. Thirty-two of the forty organizations
had already reported to him. He suggested that leaflets,
containing brief and simple rules for avoiding influenza and for
the care of the sick, be printed in several foreign languages, and
widely distributed.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c017'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c018' id='f3'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In pursuance of this suggestion a six-page leaflet was subsequently prepared and
printed in English, Italian and three other languages, and was well distributed
throughout the District.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Brown also suggested that a fund be created from which
money could be drawn to be used in paying some one in each sub-district
to look after and report upon the sanitary and health conditions
in that particular locality.</p>

<p class='c006'>Anthony C. Campbell, Esq., Fuel Administrator for this section
of the State, stated that he had received reports from various
large coal-mining companies, which had enabled him to prepare
a statement showing that from 28,000 to 30,000 tons of coal
had been lost to the industry on account of the influenza.</p>

<p class='c006'>On motion of Mr. W. C. Shepherd it was voted that all communities
in this District be requested to organize committees on
the plan endorsed or recommended by the State Board of Health.
In pursuance of this motion Chairman Dougherty appointed
Wm. C. Shepherd, Dr. Charles H. Miner, Dr. S. P. Mengel, Dr.
E. L. Meyers, A. C. Campbell and Percy A. Brown a committee
(“Ways and Means Committee”) to prepare a draft of the plan
to be used for the guidance of the several communities in this
matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>In pursuance of a motion made by Dr. Walter Davis the Chairman
appointed Dr. Davis, Dr. D. H. Lake, Dr. J. W. Geist and
Miss Nellie G. Loftus a committee to report with respect to the
systematic treatment of “flu” patients.</p>

<p class='c006'>On motion of Wm. H. Conyngham it was voted: “(1) that an
effort be made to retain here the five nurses who are now in this
community, but who have been ordered to return to Washington
on October 26; (2) that the Chairman of the General Committee
communicate by telegraph with the proper officials at Washington,
expressing our desire to have retained here, until the situation is
improved, the army doctors who are now in the field, or that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>other doctors be sent to take their places, and that as many as can
be furnished be sent.”</p>

<p class='c006'>On October 20, at a meeting of the General and District Chairmen,
in conjunction with the members of the Ways and Means
Committee, the latter presented a plan for the organization of
outlying communities. This plan was forthwith adopted and
ordered to be printed and distributed among the officials of the
various communities.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c017'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Fuel Conservator Campbell reported that
he had telegraphed to Federal Fuel Administrator Garfield,
urging him to use his influence to have the army doctors then
here kept here.</p>
<div class='footnote c018' id='f4'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This was subsequently done, in the following form:</p>

<p class='c006'>At this time the influenza and pneumonia conditions were “appalling”
in certain localities in Luzerne County. At Glen Lyon,
as well as at Georgetown in the township of Wilkes-Barré, the
situation was very serious. An average of about 75 new cases
per day in Wilkes-Barré was being reported, while all the
emergency hospitals in the District were without sufficient help.</p>

<p class='c006'>On October 22 new cases in Wilkes-Barré to the number of 120
were reported, while conditions in Glen Lyon, Nanticoke, Wanamie
and some other places in the 5th District were “desperate”.
On this date Dr. Miner and the Chairman of the General Committee
received the following communication, copies of which
were immediately transmitted by them to the various emergency
organizations in the 5th District.</p>

<div class='c019'>“October 20, 1918.</div>

<p class='c015'>“From: The Commissioner of Health of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class='c015'>“To: All concerned with Problem of Nursing during the present Epidemic
of Influenza.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Subject: Plan of Organization and Instructions. (General Order No. 2.)</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“As it is not yet fully realized that the present epidemic afflicting us in
these war times has caused the greatest need, and at the same time is
accompanied by the greatest scarcity, of graduate nurses that has ever
occurred, it is necessary to form a plan which may be adapted to any
situation, as one community after another becomes involved:</p>

<p class='c015'>“1. Graduate nurses must be used in such a way that their services be
of assistance to the greatest number. This may be done by calling first
upon all partially trained attendants, Red Cross workers, and then lay
helpers, or any intelligent persons who are able to assist, and who will
faithfully follow instructions. These latter must be instructed carefully
in the essentials for treating patients, protecting themselves, and preventing
the spread of infection, and be directed to make a simple record of
their work each day, while the graduate nurses must move about rapidly
to cover as much territory as possible if the cases are in private homes or
in small groups, supervising the work of subordinates, instructing these
subordinates, and following up their work. If the graduate is assigned
to a hospital, the same plan should be used, <i>i. e.</i>, nurses or lay helpers
detailed to small groups of patients, with the graduate in charge. Thus
an active graduate and subordinates who obey orders with military precision
get actual results which cannot be obtained by attempts to furnish
trained nurses to individual families or in quantity to hospitals.</p>

<p class='c015'>“2. It is imperative that the lives and health of physicians, nurses and
lay workers be conserved for service to the vast number afflicted. Accordingly
in each hospital (emergency, tent-hospital or otherwise) or in
each community which has been organized against the epidemic, a system
should be devised to apportion the time and labor of all workers as equally
as possible, according to the character of their work. All precautions
against infection must be constantly observed, <i>e. g.</i>, the wearing of gowns
which cover the entire body; masks made by applying eight layers of surgical
gauze, or two of butter cloth, to the convex surface of a wire tea-strainer
about four inches in diameter, which is molded to fit the face
from above the tip of the nose to below the point of the chin and secured
to the head by tapes, (gauze changed every hour and boiled half an hour,
sun dried and used over again); by the use of antiseptics, including careful
cleansing of the hands after handling patients, before eating, etc., and
care in destroying by burning or sterilizing infected material.</p>

<p class='c015'>“3. Strict discipline (semi-military) is essential for saving time and
insuring accuracy in receiving and executing orders. All personal differences
and likes and dislikes must be absolutely subordinated to the general
need. Those in charge of others should exercise judgment in issuing
orders to other subordinates, being careful to avoid anything which may
be unnecessary or a repetition. Subordinates will observe instructions of
their superiors without hesitation or argument. Courtesy at all times on
the part of every one concerned will result in reaching most quickly the
goal upon which our every effort is bent—the checking, if possible, of
<i>this great public disaster</i> and minimizing its crippling effect and death toll.</p>

<p class='c015'>“4. Requests for aid from stricken communities should be made to
the nearest representative of the Department of Health, who will refer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>it to the Physician in charge of the Emergency District. This includes
calls for doctors, nurses, aids, materials and any other form of relief.
The Department will make a supreme effort to satisfy all such needs as
rapidly as possible. However, where these are at hand they should be
obtained locally.</p>

<p class='c015'>“5. The best emergency hospital is the tent hospital, where the patient
may obtain fresh air for twenty-four hours and receive sunlight by being
hauled out into the company streets during the day. Wooden shacks or
lean-tos (like those used in T. B. treatment), the walls of which may be
raised by hinges and pulleys to admit the air and sunlight, are excellent.
Buildings without balconies or porches should not be used unless there is
adequate room or window space. Open air schools are almost ideal; next
to them are modern high schools with large grounds about them. Visitors
should be excluded, except relatives of dying patients, who should wear
gowns and masks during the visit.</p>

<p class='c015'>“6. Encourage the people of the community who wish to do something
for the sufferers but cannot nurse them, to make masks, gowns and
other supplies, also broths or other forms of nourishing food. Traveling
kitchens or food delivered from a community kitchen by motor cars are of
great assistance to stricken families. A County Committee should be
formed for the purpose of investigating and promptly relieving distress,
financial or otherwise. This committee could enable wage earners to
remain at their employment.</p>

<p class='c015'>“7. All existing agencies (local government, organizations, societies,
orders, etc.) should be co-ordinated so that there be no uncertainty or
confusion as to what is needed and how to meet the need and no waste
of personnel or repetition of instructions or starts upon unnecessary
errands.</p>

<p class='c015'>“8. In each district, which may include several Counties, there is a
physician in full charge of the district, with permanent headquarters.
There is also a supervising nurse of the district, whose headquarters
should be the same as the District Chief’s, unless an emergency should
make another arrangement desirable. All other Department officers are
subordinates to these two representatives of the Medical and Nursing
service respectively. Reports by wire or ’phone are required daily at 1 p.m. from Supervising Nurse, District Chief, and from each County
Inspector at the Epidemic Headquarters, Harrisburg. These officers should
arrange that all of their subordinates in the district report to them at a
convenient hour prior to this time.</p>

<p class='c015'>“9. It should be borne in mind that the District Chief and Supervising
Nurse of each district are responsible for their entire district and cannot
be spared too long in any one locality. Their movements will depend upon
exigencies which may arise and orders from this office.</p>
<div class='c020'>“<span class='sc'>B. Franklin Royer.</span></div>
<div class='c020'>“Acting Commissioner of Health.”</div>

<p class='c016'>On October 23 the eighth Emergency Hospital in the 5th District
was opened in the Maffet Street School building at Plains,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Luzerne County, with Miss May Conlon, Graduate Nurse, as
chief nurse.</p>

<p class='c006'>On October 25 the following-named United States Army
medical officers, who had been on duty in the 5th District, returned,
under orders, to Camp Crane: Lieut. C. F. Bahler, Lieut.
Joseph Goldstone, Lieut. G. T. Meek and Lieut. J. a.m. Aspy.
Capt. E. L. Hendricks, being ill at Hotel Sterling, remained here
some days longer. Upon the abovementioned date General
Dougherty, Chairman of the General Committee, telegraphed to
Gen. Peyton C. March, Chief of Staff, U.S.A., as follows:</p>

<p class='c014'>“By systematic organization and effort we have been endeavoring to
combat Spanish Influenza in Luzerne County, with its population of 350,000 souls. We had 300 registered physicians in the County, of whom 115 have gone into the military service. We has over 12,000 cases [of
influenza] in the County, and have established, in addition to the regular
hospitals, seven emergency hospitals. But three medical officers of those
who were sent here from Camp Crane now remain. Six thousand mine
workers are ill with the disease, thus reducing the daily output of anthracite
coal 15,000 tons, or at the rate of 300,000 tons per month. We are
informed that you have 4,000 medical officers in training at Camp Greenleaf.
We must have twenty-five physicians sent here at once. Please give
us this number of physicians, as the spread of the disease is increasing,
and we must have medical assistance. Our doctors are exhausted.”</p>

<p class='c016'>At a meeting of the General Committee held October 26 Chairman
Dougherty reported that the Commissioners of Luzerne
County had appropriated $25,000. to be used in defraying the
expenses incurred in combating the epidemic in Luzerne County.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c017'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
It was the general opinion of the members of the committee
present that this money should not be distributed among the
various communities entitled to it until the end of the epidemic.
It was pointed out, however, that several communities had already
made applications for needed funds. It was finally decided that a
committee composed of the Chairman and three other members
of the General Committee should prepare, and report at a subsequent
meeting, a plan for the proper expenditure of the County
appropriation.</p>

<div class='footnote c018' id='f5'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>About this time the City Council of Wilkes-Barré made a special appropriation
of $5,000. to be used in fighting the “flu” in the city. This sum was in addition to the
regular annual appropriation for the city’s Bureau of Health.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Colonel Eyer reported on conditions at the Armory Emergency
Hospital, and stated that many of the patients who had died there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>were practically in a dying condition when received into the
hospital. At 9:20 o’clock p.m. the Committee adjourned and
proceeded to the Lehigh Valley Railroad station, where the following-named
United States Army medical officers were met upon
their arrival from Camp Crane, Allentown, Pennsylvania, for
epidemic work in Luzerne County, and were assigned to duty as
herein noted.</p>

<p class='c006'>Capt. H. W. Dessaussure (in command) and Lieuts. E. J.
Burke, E. Z. Brunner, L. H. Hills and J. B. McGuinness, to report
to Dr. J. W. Leckie at the Hazleton Emergency Hospital; Capts.
E. B. Chenowith and Evan S. Evans, U.S.M.C., to the Wilkes-Barré
Armory Hospital; Lieuts. Robert Funston and A. C. Hall
to report to Dr. Stricker at Nanticoke; Lieut. Frank F. Davis to
report to Dr. Stricker for service at Glen Lyon; Lieut. Leroy
Fredericks to report to Dr. Stricker for service at the Wanamie
Emergency Hospital; Lieut. H. R. Lipscomb to be physician in
charge at the Plains Emergency Hospital.</p>

<p class='c006'>On this date, according to a report submitted by the County
Medical Inspector to the State department of Health, the number
of influenza and pneumonia patients undergoing treatment in the
various hospitals in the 5th District were as follows: Hazleton
Emergency, 22; Exeter Emergency, 70; Dupont Emergency, 9;
Wanamie Emergency, 55; Wilkes-Barré Armory Emergency, 46;

Valley Homœopathic, 15; Nanticoke State, 13; Mercy, 30;
Wilkes-Barré City, 64; Bloomsburg, 19; Berwick, 26. (Riverside
Hospital, Wilkes-Barré, had received no “flu” patients.)</p>

<p class='c006'>On October 28 new cases in Luzerne County were reported as
follows: Edwardsville, 40; Wilkes-Barré City, 98; Wilkes-Barré
Township, 16; Larksville, 19; Plymouth Borough, 50; Plymouth
Township, 12; Laflin, 10; Miners Mills, 29; Parsons, 18; Plains

West Hazleton,72; Seybertsville,2; Neuremburg,22; Nanticoke,
64; Nescopeck,3—making a total of 956 new cases in Luzerne
County.</p>

<p class='c006'>On October 28 a joint-meeting of the General and Coöperation
Committees was held in the rooms of the Wilkes-Barré Chamber
of Commerce.</p>

<p class='c006'>Chairman Brown stated that the biggest problem with which
the Coöperation Committee had to deal was that respecting
nurses. He further stated that something should be done immediately
to establish organizations in those communities. He
advocated more pay for nurses, and said he believed that a sufficient
number of nurses could be secured, whereby better progress
would be made in combating the scourge.</p>

<p class='c006'>After some discussion it was voted that in Luzerne County the
pay of graduate nurses should be fixed at $120 per month, and that
of practical nurses at $75 per month. It was also voted that all
nurses should be under the control of Miss Loftus and the General
Committee.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was decided to recommend the placarding of all homes in
which influenza existed in all cities, boroughs and first-class townships
in Luzerne County. Also, that all matters of publicity
concerning the “flu” in Luzerne County should be handled by the
Chairman of the Coöperation Committee.</p>

<p class='c006'>Following the adjournment of this meeting the following
“Publicity Bulletin” was issued.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A meeting of all District Chairmen and members of the Ways and
Means Committee was held this morning in the auditorium of the Chamber
of Commerce. Reports received showed that in certain outlying boroughs
and townships officials charged with the protection of the lives of
their constituents, as well as the general health of their respective communities,
are placing the lives of their people below their selfish aims by
playing politics. It was decided that, unless the said officials take immediate
steps to bring about proper organization and protection of their
respective communities, action will be taken at once to have them removed
and their places filled by people with a sense of honor, and who will give
to their communities the protection to which they are entitled.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It was also decided that there is a great need for field nurses, and
that the sooner a sufficient number of such nurses can be secured, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>sooner the epidemic will be checked in our community. It was decided to
pay graduate nurses $120. per month and practical nurses $75. per month.
All nurses will be in charge of Miss Nellie G. Loftus, who is stationed at
the Wyoming Valley Dispensary, 184, South Washington Street, Wilkes-Barré.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It was also brought to the attention of the meeting that newspaper
reports secured from people in boroughs and townships are not accurate,
and that the same are an injustice to the said communities. In one community,
where it was reported that thirteen deaths had occurred, correct
figures show that the deaths numbered only three. Therefore, it was
decided that the General Committee should be responsible for publicity
given out only by the Chairman of the Coöperation Committee, to whom
are sent all official reports from communities.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It was also decided to recommend to the officials of all cities, boroughs
and first-class townships in Luzerne County the placarding of homes in
which influenza exists.</p>
<div class='c020'>[Signed] “<span class='sc'>Percy A. Brown</span>,</div>
<div class='c020'>“Chairman of the Coöperation Committee.”</div>

<p class='c016'>Reports to the Coöperation Committee on October 31 showed 709 new cases of influenza and 67 deaths theretofore unreported
in forty-eight communities of Luzerne County—indicating a decrease
in the number of new cases, but no decrease in the number
of deaths.</p>

<p class='c006'>On November 4 only seventy-three new cases in Wilkes-Barré
were reported, and there were very gratifying indications that the
scourge was subsiding in most parts of Luzerne County. It was
estimated that 10,000 coal miners in the County were idle because
of the “flu.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A well-attended meeting of the General Committee was held in
the auditorium of the Wilkes-Barré Chamber of Commerce in the
evening of November 6, with Chairman Dougherty presiding and
Hayden Williams as Secretary. The County Medical Inspector,
in reporting on conditions in his District, stated that Berwick in
Columbia County and Plains in Luzerne County were still having
a serious time with the epidemic. Nanticoke, he said, had also
been hard hit. He stated that in Newport Township, Luzerne
County, 249 people had died from the influenza. He declared
that, while conditions in general were improved, new cases and
deaths would likely continue to occur during the next three or
four weeks.</p>

<p class='c006'>The County Medical Inspector took advantage of this occasion
to declare that too much could not be said about the good work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>accomplished by the general organization in Luzerne County,
which had been the salvation of the entire County. Without it the
loss of life would have been considerably greater, and many communities
would have felt the full force of the epidemic. He then
read a communication from the Acting Commissioner of Health,
which he had received a short time previously, in part as follows:</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where churches and schools have been closed during the epidemic of
influenza, great care should be practised at the time of removing restrictions.
Many children have been kept completely out of danger during this
dangerous period, and to open too soon and run the chance of bringing
them into contact with persons who have recently recovered, and who may
perhaps be carriers, may again bring fresh outbreaks of the disease, particularly
among school children.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then, too, thousands of public, private and parochial school teachers
have been actively engaged in nursing, and these teachers should have a
few days of rest—preferably a week—and ought to be absent from work
at the bedsides of the sick for that period of time before returning to the
schools or to crowded services.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I would urge that you take these things into consideration, and in
conference with the School Boards arrange for resuming sessions, so far
as possible, when two-thirds of the children in any school district are
ready to return from homes where no one has suffered with influenza for
a period of seven days. Where possible, medical or nursing supervision
would be advisable—especially for a few days after opening the schools.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I would suggest that, so far as practicable, the resumption of school
work should take place about midweek, and of Churches and Sunday
Schools on the Sunday following. This will bring children gradually
together, and will avoid the overcrowding apt to occur in Sunday Schools
if these schools were first opened. It is not necessary to tell you that
fifty per cent. of the Sunday Schools are conducted in buildings not as
well ventilated as are the public schools.”</p>

<p class='c016'>It was stated, in this connection, that over 2,000 school teachers
throughout the State had been active in helping to fight the
epidemic.</p>

<p class='c006'>Upon motion of Percy A. Brown it was voted to publish the
letter of the Acting Commissioner of Health, and to urge all
school boards and Sunday Schools not to reopen their schools
without first consulting the Boards of Health of their respective
localities, to learn whether or not the resumption of school
sessions would cause a further spread of the epidemic.</p>

<p class='c006'>Chairman Dougherty, referring to the work of the various
committees in this locality during the epidemic, stated that, while
talking at Harrisburg a few days previously with Dr. Royer, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Acting Commissioner of Health, the latter informed him that the
epidemic organization in Luzerne County was “<i>the finest in the
country, and the people of this County deserve great credit for
the work done</i>.” General Dougherty then read a letter which he
had just received from the Acting Commissioner, in part as
follows:</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am very greatly indebted to you for the splendid story of the Emergency
hospitals, and to note what a tremendous amount of public interest
your committee has aroused. It is only by such community service that
it has been possible to save the number of lives of miners that we have
saved during this public health drive. Too much credit cannot be given
to your local committee, and I shall see to it that the press gives the local
people a great share of credit.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Wm. C. Shepherd expressed the opinion that the General Committee
should communicate to the various communities in the
County the suggestions of the State Department of Health with
reference to the lifting of the quarantine ban wherever it had
been imposed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Percy A. Brown, Chairman of the Coöperation Committee,
reported that while the latest reports received showed there had
been a general falling off of the disease, the daily average of new
cases was about seven per district, compared with a recent average
of ten per district. He stated that he expected to send out on
the ensuing day, to every community chairman in Luzerne
County, a questionnaire asking for certain information regarding
the total number of cases and of deaths that had occurred since
the beginning of the epidemic, together with a complete record of
all workers, paid and volunteer. Later on, he said, he hoped to
have a meeting of the various chairmen, with a view to forming
an organization to prevent a recurrence of dangerous conditions
during future epidemics.</p>

<p class='c006'>County Controller Hendershot suggested that Chairman
Brown’s questionnaire should include a call for information with
respect to the number of children orphaned by the epidemic. He
said that if he could secure such information he would take it to
Harrisburg and endeavor to secure additional aid from the State
for the care of such children. He said he believed that the State
would increase the Mothers’ Pension Fund appropriation in order
to handle such cases.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Wm. C. Shepherd declared that the gathering of various statistics,
as proposed, would bring together valuable information
for use in preparing for publication a history of the epidemic.
These facts, in his judgment, should be printed and preserved for
the benefit of future generations. In this connection the Rev.
Father McCabe suggested that it would be wise not to take the
census of the various communities until the epidemic was
thoroughly stamped out. Dr. S. P. Mengel also stated that it
would be unwise to take a census until the epidemic was over;
and, as to the final data to be secured by a census, he said that
only those facts furnished by the medical authorities should be
accepted, inasmuch as no one else was competent to determine
whether or not a person alleged to have been ill with influenza
had suffered from that disease or something else.</p>

<p class='c006'>The County Medical Inspector told of what had been done at
Pottsville, Schuylkill County, towards taking care of the children
made orphans by the epidemic. He also stated that he would like
to see a community census taken, and a permanent record made
of all persons who had helped in combating the epidemic in
Luzerne County.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. E. L. Meyers, a member of the School Board of the City of
Wilkes-Barré, told of the good work performed by school teachers
during the epidemic and in various public movements, and
suggested that, when a census of community conditions should be
made, the aid of school teachers and school superintendents
should be enlisted in the work. He then offered the following
resolution, which was unanimously adopted.</p>

<p class='c014'>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the Chairman of the Coöperation Committee be instructed
to appeal to the various school superintendents in Luzerne County
for assistance in the making of a community census, for the purpose of
ascertaining desired information in connection with the Influenza Epidemic,
as well as for the protection of all communities against future epidemics.
The questionnaire to be used by the school teachers in the making of the
said census to be prepared by a committee of physicians to be named by
the Chairman of the General Committee.”</p>

<p class='c016'>In pursuance of this resolution Chairman Dougherty appointed
Drs. E. L. Meyers, S. P. Mengel, J. W. Geist and G. A. Clark a
committee to prepare the proposed census questionnaire.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Chairman then called attention to the necessity of devising
a plan for the distribution of the money appropriated by Wilkes-Barré
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>City and Luzerne County for epidemic work. He called
especial attention to the fact that it was not the intention of the
General Committee to expend the money in a haphazard manner,
but that only such bills as the respective communities should be
properly relieved of would be paid. The greatest care should be
exercised in arranging a plan that, when worked out, would give
a square deal to all the communities and effect a general feeling
of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thereupon, on motion of Percy A. Brown, it was voted that
the Chairman of the General Committee should name a committee
to be known as the “Committee for the Distribution of Funds for
the Care and Relief of Influenza Victims”; which committee
should devise and carry out a plan for “the distribution of the
funds provided for the expenses of emergency hospitals and the
relief of victims of the Influenza Epidemic in Luzerne County.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was further voted that this committee, before deciding upon
a plan of distribution, should procure as much information as
possible relative to the number of cases in each community, as
well as the expenses incurred by the several communities.</p>

<p class='c006'>In response to an inquiry made by the County Medical Inspector,
it was decided that the rates of pay for nurses, agreed upon at
the joint-meeting of the General and Coöperation Committees
held on October 28, should, in each instance, run from the beginning
of the nurse’s service.</p>

<p class='c006'>In pursuance of the action of this meeting Chairman Dougherty
subsequently appointed the following-named gentlemen to
compose the Committee for the Distribution of Funds. William
H. Conyngham, Dr. Charles H. Miner, John O’Donnell, James M.
Stack, Fuller R. Hendershot, Harry W. Ruggles, William J.
Ruff, Percy A. Brown, William C. Shepherd and Gen. Charles B.
Dougherty. At a later date the members of the committee met
and organized by selecting William C. Shepherd Chairman, William
J. Ruff Treasurer, and L. K. Eldridge Secretary.</p>

<p class='c006'>On Thursday, November 7, the General Committee came to an
understanding with the various municipal, school and Church
authorities that it would be safe to re-open saloons and bar-rooms
on Saturday, November 9, churches on Sunday, November 10,
moving-picture houses, theaters, dance-halls, etc., on November 11, Sunday Schools on November 17, and public, parochial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>and private schools (which had been closed on October 5) on
November 18.</p>

<p class='c006'>On November 5 the Catawissa Emergency Hospital (which had
been established in a private residence) was closed. According to
the final report received from the hospital there had been on the
staff six physicians (including the chief), five Graduate Nurses
and two orderlies. Thirty-nine patients had been admitted, of
whom two died.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hazleton Emergency Hospital was closed on November 8.
The staff had consisted of two U.S.A. medical officers, five
orderlies and enlisted men, one Graduate Nurse for five days,
and a number of volunteer nurses—most of whom were school
teachers. Dr. J. W. Leckie was in charge when the hospital
closed. The total number of patients admitted to this hospital
was 109, of which number 55 had pneumonia and 54 influenza.
One influenza patient and forty-two pneumonia patients died—fourteen
dying within twenty-four hours after their admission to
the hospital.</p>

<p class='c006'>Exeter Emergency Hospital was closed on November 11, at
which time Dr. James Dixon was the physician in charge. There
had been nine Graduate Nurses and three practical nurses on the
staff, three volunteer nurses and, for a part of the time, three
orderlies. Influenza patients to the number of 90 and pneumonia
patients to the number of 79 (making a total of 169) were
admitted, of which number 42 pneumonia patients died—13 dying
within twenty-four hours after their admission to the hospital.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nanticoke Emergency Hospital was closed on November 13, at
which time Lieut. C. E. Yates, U.S.A., was the physician in
charge, assisted by Miss Olwen Williams, Graduate Nurse. The
staff had comprised four physicians (including the Chief), three
medical officers, U.S.A., three Graduate Nurses, forty-three
volunteer nurses, one medical student and seven orderlies. Thirty
influenza and 121 pneumonia cases had been admitted, and forty-one
of the latter had died—fourteen dying within twenty-four
hours after their admission to the hospital.</p>

<p class='c006'>Wanamie Emergency Hospital was closed on November 14, at
which time the physicians in charge were William H. Corrigan
and Lieut. L. W. Frederick, U.S.A., assisted by W. R. Stewart,
a medical student. Nine Graduate Nurses and five Practical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Nurses (at different times), eleven volunteer nurses, thirty nurses’
aids, thirty-one Sisters of Mercy, seven orderlies and one medical
student were members of the staff at one time and another. Thirty
influenza patients and 157 pneumonia patients were admitted to
the hospital. Forty-nine of the latter died—twenty-one dying
within twenty-four hours after their admission.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Wilkes-Barré Armory Emergency Hospital was closed on
November 14. As previously noted, this hospital was opened for
the reception of patients on October 16, with the following staff:
Capt. E. L. Hendricks, U. S. Marine Corps, physician in charge;
Mrs. J. Pryor Williamson of Wilkes-Barré, a Graduate Nurse, as
chief nurse; fifteen Graduate Nurses, nine aids and two civilian
orderlies.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c017'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c018' id='f6'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r6'>6</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>During the existence of the hospital the total number of physicians (including
the Chief) on the staff was five; the number of Graduate Nurses was fifteen; the
number of volunteer nurses was twelve (three Graduates and nine aids); the number
of orderlies was ten, and of enlisted men, fifteen.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The preparing and serving of food for the patients and the
entire staff of the hospital were in the hands of the Red Cross
Canteen service, under the capable direction of Mrs. E. Birney
Carr. For the cooking and baking of the food the services of
Mrs. P. J. Higgins were obtained, and under her expert directions
the quality and quantity of food served were beyond criticism.</p>

<p class='c006'>A system was early inaugurated for the purchasing of materials
and supplies, under which system all materials and supplies
needed, with the exception of food, were purchased by Lieut.
Charles A. Trein (of the 2d Infantry, Pennsylvania Reserve
Militia), acting as Purchasing Agent. Under this system accounts
rendered were promptly approved by Col. S. E. W. Eyer and
ordered to be paid, with little confusion and no elaborate system
of bookkeeping. With this system, and the coöperation of the
medical officers and Graduate Nurses in charge, everything moved
along with smoothness and regularity.</p>

<p class='c006'>On October 24 Captain Hendricks was recalled to his unit at
Camp Crane, Allentown, for oversea’s duty. Unfortunately he
was taken ill when about to leave Wilkes-Barré, and for three
days thereafter was confined to his bed at the Hotel Sterling.
On October 25 Lieut. Joseph Goldstone, U. S. Marine Corps,
was assigned to the Armory Hospital and remained in charge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>until October 31, when he, too, was recalled to Camp Crane to
report for oversea’s duty. Thus the hospital was deprived, for
the second time, of a faithful, conscientious, tireless worker.</p>

<p class='c006'>On October 28 Mrs. J. Pryor Williamson, a Red Cross worker
in Wilkes-Barré on extended leave, who was serving as chief
nurse at the Armory, was recalled to Washington. With her
knowledge of hospital work, her energy and her untiring efforts,
she had, in her twelve days of service at the Armory, placed the
hospital upon a working basis which left no room for doubt as to
her ability and good judgment with respect to the matters under
her supervision. Mrs. Williamson was ably succeeded at the
Armory by Miss Antoinette Schofield, Graduate Nurse, as nurse
in charge, which position she held until the closing of the hospital.</p>

<p class='c006'>On November 1 Capt. Evan S. Evans, U.S.M.C., was
assigned to the hospital, and remained as physician in charge
until November 14, when he, too, was recalled to Camp Crane.
Captain Evans, with his sunny disposition and jovial smile, made
many friends among the patients and others with whom he came
in contact.</p>

<p class='c006'>On November 14, with only three patients as inmates, it was
decided to close the hospital. Therefore, two of the three patients
were transferred to the City Hospital, and one was transferred
to the Mercy Hospital. At that time an average of about thirty
new cases of the pandemic were being reported each day in
Wilkes-Barré. In consequence, the Armory Hospital was left
intact for a period of about two weeks; but as, during that time,
no new cases were received, the wards were dismantled and the
building was fumigated and finally closed to the public on December 7.</p>

<p class='c006'>All articles of food remaining on hand at the closing of the
hospital were equally divided and donated to the Wilkes-Barré
City Hospital, Mercy Hospital and the Wyoming Valley Homœopathic
Hospital. Other articles of use and value, after being
properly fumigated, were turned over to the City of Wilkes-Barré
authorities for use in the city’s Hospital for Contagious Diseases,
then in course of construction.</p>

<p class='c006'>The total number of patients admitted to the Armory Emergency
Hospital was 192, of which number 132 were males and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>60 were females. Ninety-four of the patients were pneumonia
cases, and of these sixty-six died. Three died from influenza.
Thirty-five patients died within twenty-four hours after their admission
to the hospital. The largest number of patients admitted in
one day was eighteen—on October 17. The largest number of
patients in the hospital on any one day was 62; the largest number
of deaths on any one day was seven, and the largest number
discharged on any one day was fourteen. Eighty-six of the
patients were under thirty years of age.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of the 192 patients received into the Armory Emergency Hospital 102 were from Wilkes-Barré; 20 from Edwardsville; 22
from Swoyerville; 7 from Ashley; 6 from Plymouth; 5 each
from Kingston and Miners Mills; 4 each from Askam, Parsons
and Forty Fort; 3 from Maltby; 2 each from Larksville, Sugar
Notch, Nanticoke and Buttonwood; 1 each from Plainsville and
Dorranceton.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Plains Emergency Hospital was closed on November 18, at
which time Lieut. H. R. Lipscomb, U.S.A., was the physician in
charge, and Miss May Conlon, a Graduate Nurse, was the chief
nurse. Five different physicians (not more than one at any given
time) had served on the staff, together with four Graduate
Nurses, three practical nurses, six volunteer nurses, one medical
student, three orderlies and three enlisted men. Fifty patients
were admitted (31 influenza cases, 18 pneumonia cases and one
case of croup), and of this number thirteen of the pneumonia
patients died—three of them within twenty-four hours after their
admission to the hospital.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Dupont Emergency Hospital was closed on December 3,
at which time Dr. James S. Dixon was the physician in charge,
and Miss Bessie Fadden, Graduate Nurse, was the chief nurse—she
having succeeded Miss Herman on November 19. There had
been on the staff four Graduate Nurses, five practical nurses (who
worked part of the time), two sanitary detachments, and a number
of Sisters of the Bernardine Order who served as volunteer
nurses. One hundred and three patients were admitted to the
hospital, of whom 83 were influenza and 20 were pneumonia
cases. Twelve of the latter died—five of them within twenty-four
hours after their admission to the hospital.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>The following information, concerning influenza and pneumonia
cases treated in some of the permanent hospitals located in
the 5th District, has been derived from official reports made to
the County Medical Inspector, covering the period from October 1, 1918, to January 1, 1919.</p>

<p class='c006'>Wyoming Valley Homœopathic Hospital: Total number of
influenza cases, 68; pneumonia cases, 55; total number of
deaths, 27.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mercy Hospital: Total number of influenza cases, 133; pneumonia
cases, 131; total number of deaths, 87—including 22 who
died within twenty-four hours after their admission to the hospital.</p>

<p class='c006'>Wilkes-Barré City Hospital: Total number of cases, 457, comprising 223 influenza cases and 234 influenza-pneumonia cases.
Two hundred and thirty-four of the number were male and 223
were female patients. The total number of deaths was 135. Of
the members of the hospital staff, 72 contracted pneumonia at
the hospital, and four of them died.</p>

<p class='c006'>Pittston Hospital: Total number of influenza cases, 67 (males, 26; females, 41); pneumonia cases, 32, of which 13 terminated
fatally.</p>

<p class='c006'>State Hospital at Hazleton: Total number of influenza patients, 275; pneumonia patients, 216, of whom 113 died.</p>

<p class='c006'>Berwick Hospital: Total number of influenza cases, 113;
pneumonia cases, 25; total number of deaths, 16.</p>

<p class='c006'>On November 18 the number of cases of influenza-pneumonia
in Wilkes-Barré had increased to such an alarming degree that
the municipal authorities imposed another quarantine ban, closing
all amusement houses and prohibiting public assemblages.
Eleven days later this ban was removed, although the daily average
of new cases of influenza and pneumonia totaled about thirty-five.
The public schools of the city, however, having been closed
about two months, were not re-opened until December 4, although
at that time about eighteen new influenza cases a day were being
reported in Wilkes-Barré. Conditions in other parts of the County
seemed to be improving.</p>

<p class='c006'>On December 15, owing to the large increase in the number of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>influenza cases in Wilkes-Barré, the municipal authorities ordered
the closing of all schools except the City High School and private
schools of a corresponding grade. Also, children under fourteen
years of age were forbidden to attend theatres and motion-picture
shows, to ride in public conveyances and to visit stores. The
sessions of Sunday Schools were also directed to be discontinued.
The epidemic seemed to be particularly prevalent among children.</p>

<p class='c006'>One hundred and four cases of influenza in Wilkes-Barré were
reported on December 17, and the next day the municipal authorities
imposed additional quarantine restrictions, the chief of which
was that persons in quarantined houses—excepting physicians,
and others given special permits—should not enter or leave such
houses.</p>

<p class='c006'>On December 19 the General Committee held a meeting, which
was attended by the Health Officers of Wilkes-Barré, Dorranceton
and Hanover. Chairman Brown of the Coöperation Committee
reported that up to that date there had been 2,872 deaths
from influenza and pneumonia in Luzerne County, 345 of which
had occurred in Wilkes-Barré. The County Medical Inspector
briefly outlined the situation in the County, and stated that in
some cases officials were not reporting the true conditions in their
localities.</p>

<p class='c006'>At a meeting of the General Committee held on December 21
the County Medical Inspector stated that the conditions in the
various communities in the 5th District were such that the Acting
Commissioner of the State Department of Health was not inclined
to order any further quarantine ban, unless requested to do so by
the authorities of the respective communities. Dr. Clark, of the
Bureau of Health of Wilkes-Barré, reported that the situation in
the city during the last four days had been better than for some
time previously—only 35 new cases having been reported. He said
that so far in the month 1,020 cases had been reported, while in
November only 825 cases had been reported. More children and
fewer adults were being attacked by the disease.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mayor Kosek stated that he was averse to crippling the business
of the community, but he felt that everything possible should be
done to stamp out the epidemic. He said he was in favor of giving
the matter considerable publicity, and urged that officials in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>the outlying communities should be asked to coöperate with the
city authorities in the enforcement of regulations.</p>

<p class='c006'>Resolutions were then adopted to the effect that any further
plan for fighting the epidemic, which should be adopted, should be
enforced vigorously until all danger had passed; that places of
amusement should be closed to children; that public funerals and
overcrowding at public gatherings should be prevented. The following
resolution, offered by Dr. S. P. Mengel, was then unanimously
adopted:</p>

<p class='c014'>“<i>Resolved</i>, That this committee endorses the rules and regulations
adopted by the Board of Health of the City of Wilkes-Barré, and that we
ask for the strict enforcement of the same, and that we pledge coöperation
in aiding the authorities to bring about such enforcement; and further,
that we call upon the entire public, as well as the officials of all
communities in Luzerne County, for their coöperation in reducing the
number of cases of influenza by obeying to the letter all rules and regulations
adopted by the Wilkes-Barré Board of Health; and we also ask
the coöperation of every newspaper in Luzerne County in bringing this
matter to the attention of the people.”</p>

<p class='c016'>On December 23 Mayor Kosek of Wilkes-Barré made an
official announcement to the people of the city, to the effect that,
if they would not voluntarily observe the reasonable quarantine
regulations which had been adopted by the city authorities, he
would impose a quarantine that would be the most far-reaching
and absolute that had yet been ordered, and this without regard
to what interests might be thereby affected.</p>

<p class='c006'>At this time the officers of the Bureau of Health of the city
were firmly opposed to the lifting of the ban with respect to public
dances, cabarets, Sunday School sessions, and other public assemblages
during the approaching holiday season. However, about
the first of January, 1919, the ban against moving-picture houses
was lifted, and on the 10th of the month the remaining restrictions
of the quarantine were removed, and Sunday Schools and the public
and private schools of the city resumed their sessions.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following table, compiled from official records and reports,
indicates the total number of known cases of influenza and pneumonia,
and the total number of deaths therefrom, that occurred
in Luzerne County from October 1, 1918, to January 1, 1919.</p>

<p class='c026'>Soup was distributed in Wilkes-Barré and outlying districts, and was
sent to the Visiting Nurses’ rooms and to the Home for Friendless Children.
Corresponding amounts of desserts were sent out in Wilkes-Barré,
and outlying districts, and to the Home for Friendless Children. Jellies
and marmalades were donated in large quantities, and were sent out with
the soup and desserts. The sum of $500.00 was donated for free milk for
influenza patients.</p>

<p class='c015'>Although Troop Trains were being served during the month of December,
the Canteen continued the work incidental to the epidemic. From
Canteen Headquarters large quantities of soup, custards and milk were
distributed to individuals and families in the city and outskirts. Three
thousand nine hundred and seventy-four people were served. Two thousand
four hundred and fifty-six quarts of soup were distributed; 167
quarts, with corresponding quantities of custard, were sent to Georgetown,
and 13½ quarts to the Visiting Nurses’ rooms for their lunches. Eight
hundred and five quarts of milk were distributed. Two hundred and three
lunches were packed for volunteer nurses on duty in the stricken homes.
Twenty-four quarts of ice cream were distributed on Christmas Day.
Desserts were distributed in which the following were used: 739 quarts
milk, 84 quarts gelatin, 117½ dozen eggs, 10½ dozen lemons, 4 quarts
vanilla, 47 boxes cornstarch, 53 boxes tapioca, 33 boxes gelatin, 12 boxes
lemon jello, 85 pounds sugar.</p>

<p class='c016'>At a meeting of the Greater Wilkes-Barré Chamber of Commerce
held December 10, 1918, with President Philip R. Bevan
in the chair and Hayden Williams Secretary, a very full discussion
took place with respect to the large number of children in
Luzerne County who had been orphaned by the influenza scourge
(2,390, as noted on page — <a href='#pgno'><span class='under'>n?</span></a>, <i>ante</i>)—creating a condition demanding
the serious consideration of every citizen of the County.
Thereupon the following resolution was adopted:</p>

<p class='c014'>“<i>Resolved</i>, That a committee be appointed to look into this matter, and
make recommendations at a subsequent meeting of the Chamber.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Pursuant to this resolution President Bevan appointed a committee
as follows: William C. Shepherd, <i>Chairman</i>, Percy A.
Brown, C. F. Brisbin, John N. Conyngham, Charles E. Clift,
William H. Conyngham, Fuller R. Hendershot and John D. Farnham.
This committee met on January 3, 1919, and after careful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>deliberation unanimously decided that, before any consideration
could be given to a definite plan for the permanent relief of
influenza orphans, it would be necessary to form a general committee
drawn from various sections of the County of Luzerne.
Chairman Shepherd declared that, whatever plan of relief should
be adopted, it should apply to the entire County. He said, also,
that it would have to be decided whether or not any of the children
could be taken care of by existing charitable organizations, or
whether a special institution would have to be established.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hendershot, and others present, raised the question as to
whether or not any of the children could be taken care of by the
Mothers’ Pension Fund. It was admitted that if this were done
the appropriations for the Fund would have to be increased. It
was stated that, as there were some Counties in the State which
did not have such a Fund, the local Board might be able to secure
an increase in its appropriations from the State funds not drawn
upon by other Counties entitled thereto.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Brisbin told of the investigation then going on by members
of the Red Cross, and others, under his direction, in order to
ascertain all conditions surrounding each individual affected by
the ravages of the pandemic. He said that when the inquiries
should be completed, in the course of two or three weeks, there
would be definite information as to the exact number of orphans
for whom permanent provision would have to be made. He said
that in many cases orphans would either be placed in the care of
relatives, or others, and that in the end the number to be provided
for by the public would not be as large as then anticipated.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was then resolved, upon motion of Mr. Brown, that a committee,
representative of the entire County, should be appointed:</p>

<p class='c027'>“To devise plans for the permanent relief of all influenza orphans needing
the same; and that prior to a meeting of this General Committee to be
held on January 20, 1919, the Secretary should communicate with the
various cities in Pennsylvania and other States, in which the epidemic had
been serious, for the purpose of securing information regarding permanent
relief plans adopted in those cities.”</p>
<p class='c016'>In pursuance of this resolve it was decided that the following-named
persons should be invited to come together at the Chamber
of Commerce on January 20, 1919, at 3 o’clock p.m., for the
purpose of effecting a “permanent organization for the relief of
influenza orphans in Luzerne County.” William C. Shepherd,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Percy A. Brown, C. F. Brisbin, William H. Conyngham, John N.
Conyngham, John D. Farnham, Hon. S. J. Strauss, Hon. J. V.
Kosek, Miss Anna Koons, Charles F. Huber, Miss Mary Brady,
Miss Rose O’Hara, Dr. Charles H. Miner, Dr. S. P. Mengel,
Eugene W. Mulligan, Anthony C. Campbell, Mrs. George
Galland, Mrs. Francis A. Phelps, Mrs. Andrew F. Derr, Miss
Hobart, Miss Nellie Ritchie, Mrs. J. D. Davenport, Victor Lee

Michael Lonski, F. H. Kohlbraker, Mrs. George G. Brader
and Mrs. Oliver Bell of Nanticoke; Fuller R. Hendershot, Dr. H.
L. Whitney, H. L. Freeman, Michael Maras and the Hon. Asa K.
De Witt of Plymouth; Mayor Henry W. Heidenreich and Harry
A. Schmoll of Hazleton; William Bray of Freeland; D. A.
Mulherin of Glen Lyon; the Rev. M. A. Dauber of Pike’s Creek;
Robert Mulhall, William Joseph Peck, M. N. Donnelly, Mayor
James Kennedy, M. W. O’Boyle, W. L. Watson, W. J. Kilgallen
and Mrs. Joseph Peck of Pittston; Samuel M. Parke of West
Pittston; Mrs. E. E. Buckman, Mrs. Laurance M. Thompson and
Harry W. Ruggles of Dorranceton; the Rev. F. Kasaczun of
Sugar Notch; V. B. Sheeder and the Rev. Mr. Gillespie of
Wanamie; the Rev. Selden L. Haynes, the Rev. J. F. Jedlicka
and Hubbard B. Payne of Kingston; the Rev. J. E. Gryczka of
Edwardsville; James L. Reilly, Secretary of the Poor Board of
the Central District of Luzerne County.</p>

<p class='c006'>In response to notices sent out to the aforementioned persons,
about thirty-five of them assembled in the auditorium of the
Wilkes-Barré Chamber of Commerce in the afternoon of January 20, 1919. At the request of Chairman Shepherd Mr. John N.
Conyngham acted as Chairman <i>pro tem.</i> Mr. Shepherd then explained
the purpose of the meeting, and the necessity for providing
some satisfactory method of taking care of the children
throughout the County who had been left in a destitute condition
by the influenza pandemic.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Chairman <i>pro tem.</i> asked whether or not a permanent
organization should be formed. Mr. Mulhall thought that it
would be wise to work through some organization already in
existence and possessing power to enforce any law relating to the
situation. He suggested the United Charities as such an organization,
and supplementary to this suggestion Mr. Schmoll reported
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>that in Hazleton forty-six influenza orphans were at that
time being taken care of by the United Charities of that City.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Galland, President of the Mothers’ Pension Fund, thought
it would be the best plan to leave as many children as possible with
their surviving parents, and that practically all cases could be
handled by the Pension Fund—provided appropriations for it
should be sufficiently increased.</p>

<p class='c006'>On motion of the Rev. Mr. Haynes it was finally voted that a
temporary organization be formed, to be known as the “Chamber
of Commerce Coöperation Committee”, to coöperate with existing
agencies in making investigations and providing relief for all
deserving cases.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Brisbin, Chairman of the Civilian Relief Department of the
Wyoming Valley Chapter of the Red Cross, stated that his department
had begun investigations, regardless of any arrangements
made, or to be made, by other committees or organizations. It
had been stated that the Women’s Committee of the Council of
National Defense was about to institute an investigation of the
orphan problem along the same lines being followed by the Red
Cross, and Mr. Brisbin called attention to the danger of serious
confusion and complications as a result of this overlapping work.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Phelps and Miss Brady (the latter an employé of the
United Charities of Wilkes-Barré) spoke of conditions found by
them in many homes where poverty reigned, and where it was
necessary that something should be done immediately to save
these families from being ejected from their homes by landlords
because they could not pay their rents. Thereupon Mr. Mulhall
inquired why the Poor Boards could not pay the rents of families
in destitute circumstances. Mr. Dodson said that while the
Poor Board of the Central District was publicly not in favor of
paying rents, he believed it would take care of the rent question
quietly by paying money for that purpose to the United Charities.
Mr. Farnham stated that the Red Cross had some money which
might be used for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>Upon motion of Mr. Hendershot it was then voted that a committee
be appointed to work in conjunction with the State Department
of Health in an attempt to secure from the State Legislature
financial relief for all influenza orphans. As such committee the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Chairman appointed Fuller R. Hendershot, John D. Farnham and
Percy A. Brown.</p>

<p class='c006'>Upon motion of Mr. Haynes it was then voted to adjourn until
January 22, at which time efforts would be made to devise an
immediate plan for the permanent relief of influenza victims; and
that the Secretary should invite to this meeting representatives
of the Red Cross, the United Charities, and the Poor Boards in
Luzerne and Carbon Counties.</p>

<p class='c006'>The adjourned meeting of the Chamber of Commerce Coöperation
Committee held on January 22, 1919, was attended by
about twenty persons. Mr. William C. Shepherd presided, and
L. K. Eldridge acted as Secretary. Mr. Shepherd stated that it
was the consensus of opinion that, so far as possible, all orphans
should be kept in their respective homes or be taken care of by
relatives or friends. Mr. Brisbin outlined the work being done
by the Civilian Relief Department of the Red Cross, stating that
cases were being investigated, and that in his judgment the County
had organizations enough to take care of the work, but that money
was greatly needed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thereupon Mr. Hendershot moved that a committee be appointed
to confer with the Poor Board, the Red Cross and other
organizations with a view to obtaining money for carrying on the
relief work. This motion having been carried the Chairman
appointed the following committee, to be known as the “Ways
and Means Committee”: William H. Conyngham (Chairman),
Dr. Charles H. Miner, Anthony C. Campbell, Harold N. Rust and
the Rev. Selden L. Haynes.</p>

<p class='c006'>Charles E. Keck, Esq., Solicitor for the Poor Board of the
Central District, then outlined the duties and limitations of that
Board, and stated that the members of the Board would be very
glad to meet the committee just appointed and go over with them
the matter of providing funds for needed relief. At this point
Judge S. J. Strauss made some very timely remarks to the effect
that a committee should be appointed to provide means for increasing
the capacity and usefulness of the Wilkes-Barré Home
for Friendless Children. He stated that, in his opinion,
additional organizations were not necessary, but that the Committee
should co-operate with those already existing.</p>

<p class='c006'>At a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce Coöperation Committee
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>held on January 31, 1919, Mr. Rust, reporting for the Ways
and Means Committee, stated that the latter had conferred with
the attorney for the Poor Board of the Central District, who
informed the committee that in any case where immediate relief
was required the Board would investigate and then administer
such relief as was necessary.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Rust was of the opinion that, inasmuch as the taxpayers
had provided funds for the Poor Board, action should be taken by
this Committee to see that the Board properly took care of worthy
cases. Further, that as the law of the State prohibits the paying
of rents by the Board, the matter of rents should be taken care of
by the Red Cross; that there should be close coöperation between
Wyoming Valley Chapter of the Red Cross and the Poor Board
of the Central District in the matter of investigating cases; that
immediate relief, when needed, should be furnished, and that the
disbursement of funds should be divided between the Poor Board
and the Red Cross. Mr. Farnham stated that in his opinion the
funds of the Red Cross would be available as far as they would
go.</p>

<p class='c006'>On motion of Mr. Rust it was then voted that the Civilian
Relief Department of Wyoming Valley Chapter of the Red Cross
take to the Poor Board of the Central District the fifty specific
cases which they had investigated; that these cases should be
checked up against those receiving relief from the Central Poor
District, and if it should be ascertained that there were any who
were not receiving relief, the District be requested to add such
names to their list for immediate investigation and relief; that
the District pay for food, coal, etc., and that funds for the payment
of rents be placed in the hands of the Civilian Relief Department
of the Red Cross.</p>

<p class='c006'>On motion of Mrs. George Galland it was voted that the Coöperation
Committee of the Chamber of Commerce endorses the
action of the Commissioners of Luzerne County in agreeing to
appropriate $25,000 to the Mothers’ Pension Fund provided the
State of Pennsylvania would appropriate $1,000,000 to the general
fund.</p>

<p class='c006'>A meeting of the Coöperation Committee of the Chamber of
Commerce was held on February 19, 1919, with William C. Shepherd
presiding and L. K. Eldridge acting as Secretary. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>minutes of the meeting held on January 31 were read and approved.
Mr. Rust reported concerning the conference held by
the Ways and Means Committee with the Poor Board of the
Central District, stating that the latter had agreed to carry out, so
far as possible, the recommendations set forth in the resolution of
the Coöperation Committee adopted on January 31. The support
promised by the Poor Board would cover medical assistance, food,
clothing, and nursing when necessary; the Red Cross to pay rents.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. McLaughlin reported that the original fifty relief cases
had been turned over to the Poor Board, together with 202 additional
cases. The Poor Board had stated that 90% of these
cases were already in their hands, under investigation. It was
also reported that several day nurseries were under consideration,
which would permit mothers to leave their children there and
take up employment. Mrs. Phelps stated that in a number of
cases widows had not yet received their insurance money; that
some of the societies in which insurance had been carried were
said to be bankrupt, while some of the larger insurance companies
were holding up the payment of amounts due on policies of deceased
victims of the epidemic.</p>

<p class='c006'>On motion of Mr. Rust Mr. Brisbin was authorized to increase
the membership of the Civilian Relief Committee so as to meet
the requirements of the situation of affairs. It was voted, also,
that he be given full power to discuss and decide all matters with
the Central Poor Board, and that he consider the wisdom of
employing persons to do social service work during the ensuing
three months.</p>

<p class='c006'>On April 30, 1919, a quorum of the Chamber of Commerce Coöperation
Committee met in the Chamber of Commerce auditorium.
Chairman Shepherd stated that, inasmuch as the Red
Cross and the Poor Board of the Central District were taking
care of matters for which the Coöperation Committee had been
constituted, it was his judgment that the Committee should be
discharged from further consideration of the matters in question.
Mr. Schmoll stated that in Hazleton all cases had been taken care
of through regular channels, and to the best of his knowledge
there were no destitute cases at that time. Mrs. Bell reported
that in Nanticoke there were twelve cases where rents were being
paid, and would be paid as long as necessary, by the Red Cross.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Mr. Conyngham stated that the work of the Red Cross, at that
time, was confined to the paying of rents. He could not say,
however, how much longer this work could be continued. It was
suggested that, when the Red Cross had reached the limits in its
work of paying rents, the Poor Board should take over the cases
in Nanticoke. Mrs. McLaughlin stated that up to that date 630
old cases and 75 new ones in the Central District had been turned
over to the Poor Board.</p>

<p class='c006'>On motion of Mr. Conyngham it was voted to request the Poor
Board to employ as many experienced women as necessary to
investigate and look after cases after the Red Cross and other
organizations had retired from activity in the field. The Rev.
Dr. Farr suggested that the Coöperation Committee should receive
from Mr. Brisbin a full and final report of the important
work done by the Civilian Relief Committee of Wyoming Valley
Chapter of the Red Cross, which work had been carried on under
the direction and management of Mr. Brisbin, and has been
briefly referred to hereinbefore.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c017'><sup>[7]</sup></a> There being no further business
to be transacted, the Committee adjourned <i>sine die</i>.</p>

<div class='footnote c018' id='f7'>
<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r7'>7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A full report of the work performed by the Civilian Relief Committee will be
found in the “History of Wyoming Valley Chapter of the American Red Cross,” soon
to be published.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The “Committee for the Distribution of Funds for the Care
and Relief of Influenza Victims”, whose appointment is noted
hereinbefore, held various meetings for the transaction of business
connected with the duties confided to it. At a meeting held
March 21, 1919, affairs relative to the various Emergency Hospitals
were thoroughly discussed, following which Mr. Conyngham
moved that all bills of the General Committee be paid at
once. This motion was carried. Mr. Hendershot then moved
that the Treasurer be instructed to pay the amounts of the various
Emergency Hospital bills which had been approved by the Committee.
This motion was carried.</p>

<p class='c006'>At a subsequent meeting this Committee unanimously adopted
the following rules of procedure relative to the settlement of bills
arising out of the establishing of the seven Emergency Hospitals
in Luzerne County:</p>

<p class='c014'>“(1) That the verified bills for the construction work of buildings, or
altering or equipping temporary hospitals, should be paid.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“(2) That the verified bills for the daily maintenance—consisting of
food, drugs, medicines, and the overhead expense of light and fuel—together
with such special expenses as were approved by the General Committee
in relation to the general organization work throughout the County,
be approved and paid.</p>

<p class='c015'>“(3) That bills in connection with the regularly established hospitals,
and bills relating to the regular hospitals and charities, and the work of
attendants in isolated homes, could not be approved and paid, as the
moneys appropriated for this epidemic were appropriated for the specific
purpose of the establishment and maintenance of hospitals for this work.”</p>

<p class='c016'>At a meeting of the Distribution Committee held April 4, 1919,
it was resolved to issue to the public a “Letter of information concerning
the work of the Distribution Committee”. This letter
was subsequently prepared, giving a brief account of the organization
of the committee and the work it had accomplished, and,
having been signed by the members of the committee, was duly
disseminated. The following paragraphs are extracts from this
letter:</p>

<p class='c014'>“The appropriation of funds by Luzerne County was made under an
Act of the Pennsylvania Legislature approved May 14, 1915, and reading
in part as follows:</p>

<p class='c015'>“‘<i>Section 1.</i> * * * The County Commissioners of any County may
appropriate moneys for the support of any hospital, located within or without
the limits of such County, which is engaged in charitable work and
extends treatment and medical attention to residents of such County.</p>

<p class='c015'>“‘<i>Section 2.</i> All Acts and parts of Acts inconsistent with this Act are
repealed.’</p>

<p class='c015'>“The appropriation of the City of Wilkes-Barré was made by the members
of the City Council by a resolution reading as follows:</p>

<p class='c015'>“‘<i>Whereas</i>, the equipment and maintenance of the Emergency Hospital
at the Armory is necessary to fight the influenza epidemic; and whereas
much of the equipment can be later used at the Emergency Contagious
Disease Hospital of the city of Wilkes-Barré which is now nearing
completion,</p>

<p class='c015'>“<i>Therefore, Be it Resolved</i>, That the City of Wilkes-Barré appropriate
$5,000., or so much thereof as may be necessary, toward the equipment and
maintenance of the Armory or other Hospital; that the Citizens’ Committee

Valley Chapter of the American Red Cross was very active in securing volunteer
nurses, so that we had during the epidemic seventy Graduate Nurses (including seven
State Nurses), fourteen Visiting Nurses of the Visiting Nurses’ Association, forty-four
Practical Nurses and eighty nurses’ aids, working under the very efficient direction
of Miss Nellie G. Loftus, the nurse in charge of District No. 5.”</p>
